# Default configuration for job-runner

# This file contains the default settings for job-runner and will always be
# read in order to get the defaults.  It is also meant to act as a rudimentary
# form of documentation for the options which are available.

# Anything in this file can be overridden by installing a file with a similar
# format in one of the following locations (in order of precedence):
#   - the path specified via `--config-file`
#   - the path specified via the `JOB_RUNNER_CONFIG` environment variable
#   - XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cockpit-dev/job-runner.toml

# The defaults from this file are merged with overrides from the first such
# file found.

# The default configuration is intentionally broken.  You'll need to provide a
# configuration which (at least) does one of:
#  - provides a valid GitHub API token; and/or
#  - sets forge.github.post to false
