    # If the insights-client is installed, update the insights-client
    # "egg" and make sure that only the newest one is used.
    #
    # Running "insights-client --status" will download the newest egg to
    # /var/lib/insights (and then output some status that we are not
    # really interested in).
    #
    # Normally, newest.egg is then copied automatically to last_stable.egg
    # once it has successfully been used once.
    #
    # But the idea is here that we only want to ever run newest.egg and if
    # it is broken, we want to know about that, instead of having the
    # insights-client fall back to an older egg. Thus, we promote
    # newest.egg to last_stable.egg unconditionally and immediately.
    # Removing rpm.egg takes that fallback out of the equation, too.
    #
    # Also, "insights-client --version" only looks at last_stable.egg or
    # rpm.egg, never at newest.egg. So copying newest.egg to
    # last_stable.egg makes that work as expected, too.
